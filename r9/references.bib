abstract = {In a new type of illumination system for reflective liquid-crystal displays, the frontlight, unwanted shadows appear in certain viewing directions. It will be shown that for an accurate description of these shadows the geometrical optics approach is not satisfactory and that Fresnel diffraction has to be taken into account. A model for the diffraction effects was developed, and the predicted results correspond well to the measurements. In addition, some remarkable effects were explained from the theory of Fresnel zones.},
